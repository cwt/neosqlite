# NeoSQLite Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive testing strategy for NeoSQLite, including the test suite for AggregationCursor and temporary table aggregation functionality, as well as coverage improvements for key modules.

## Test Coverage

2. **Iterator Protocol Tests**
   - Test `__iter__` method returns the cursor itself
   - Test `__next__` method for proper iteration and StopIteration handling
   - Test integration with Python's built-in iteration mechanisms

3. **Utility Method Tests**
   - Test `__len__` method for counting results
   - Test `__getitem__` method for indexed access
