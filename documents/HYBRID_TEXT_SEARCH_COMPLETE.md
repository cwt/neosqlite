# NeoSQLite Hybrid Text Search Processing Enhancement

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive specification for implementing hybrid text search processing in NeoSQLite's aggregation pipeline system. Instead of falling back the entire pipeline to Python processing when a `$text` operator is encountered without FTS indexes, the system now processes compatible stages with SQL optimization and only falls back to Python for the specific text search operation.

## Problem Statement

Currently, when a NeoSQLite aggregation pipeline contains a `$text` operator without FTS indexes prepared beforehand, the entire pipeline falls back to slow Python processing. This negates the performance benefits of the temporary table aggregation processor for all stages, even those that could be efficiently processed with SQL.

## Solution

The hybrid approach processes aggregation pipelines as follows:

1. **Stages 1 to N-1**: Process using SQL with temporary tables
2. **Stage N (with $text)**: Process with Python-based text search
3. **Stages N+1 to M**: Continue processing with SQL using temporary tables

This approach maintains the performance benefits of SQL processing for compatible stages while only using Python where necessary.

## Key Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- Previous stages benefit from SQL optimization
- Only matching documents are loaded for text search
- Subsequent stages continue with SQL processing
- Significantly reduced memory usage

### User Experience
- Better performance for complex pipelines
- Transparent operation to end users
- Maintained backward compatibility

### Resource Efficiency
- Database-level processing for most operations
- Automatic temporary table management
- Reduced Python memory footprint

## Technical Implementation

### Core Implementation

The implementation modifies the temporary table aggregation processor to handle `$text` operators:

```python
def _process_match_stage(
    self,
    create_temp: Callable,
    current_table: str,
    match_spec: Dict[str, Any],
) -> str:
    """Process a $match stage using temporary tables."""
    # Check if text search is involved
    if _contains_text_search(match_spec):
        return self._process_text_search_stage(create_temp, current_table, match_spec)
    
    # ... rest of existing implementation for regular matches

def _process_text_search_stage(
    self,
    create_temp: Callable,
    current_table: str,
    match_spec: Dict[str, Any],
) -> str:
    """
    Process a $text search stage using Python-based filtering.
    """
    # Extract and validate search term
    if "$text" not in match_spec or "$search" not in match_spec["$text"]:
        raise ValueError("Invalid $text operator specification")
    
    search_term = match_spec["$text"]["$search"]
    if not isinstance(search_term, str):
        raise ValueError("$text search term must be a string")
    
    # Generate deterministic table name
    text_stage = {"$text": {"$search": search_term}}
    result_table_name = f"temp_text_filtered_{hashlib.sha256(str(match_spec).encode()).hexdigest()[:8]}"
    
    # Create result temporary table
    self.db.execute(f"CREATE TEMP TABLE {result_table_name} (id INTEGER, data TEXT)")
    
    # Process documents with cursor
    cursor = self.db.execute(f"SELECT id, data FROM {current_table}")
    
    # Batch insert for better performance
    batch_inserts = []
    batch_size = 1000
    
    for row_id, row_data in cursor:
        # Load document
        doc = self.collection._load(row_id, row_data)
        
        # Apply text search
        if self._matches_text_search(doc, search_term):
            batch_inserts.append((row_id, row_data))
            
            # Process batch inserts
            if len(batch_inserts) >= batch_size:
                self._batch_insert_documents(result_table_name, batch_inserts)
                batch_inserts = []
    
    # Process remaining inserts
    if batch_inserts:
        self._batch_insert_documents(result_table_name, batch_inserts)
    
    return result_table_name

def _matches_text_search(self, document: Dict[str, Any], search_term: str) -> bool:
    """
    Apply Python-based text search to a document.
    """
    from neosqlite.collection.text_search import unified_text_search
    return unified_text_search(document, search_term)

def _batch_insert_documents(self, table_name: str, documents: List[tuple]) -> None:
    """Insert multiple documents into a temporary table efficiently."""
    if not documents:
        return
        
    placeholders = ",".join(["(?,?)"] * len(documents))
    query = f"INSERT INTO {table_name} (id, data) VALUES {placeholders}"
    flat_params = [item for doc_tuple in documents for item in doc_tuple]
    self.db.execute(query, flat_params)
```

### Pipeline Validation

Update `can_process_with_temporary_tables()` to allow pipelines with `$text` operators:

```python
def can_process_with_temporary_tables(pipeline: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> bool:
    """Determine if a pipeline can be processed with temporary tables."""
    supported_stages = {
        "$match",
        "$unwind",
        "$sort",
        "$skip",
        "$limit",
        "$lookup",
        "$addFields",
    }

    for stage in pipeline:
        stage_name = next(iter(stage.keys()))
        if stage_name not in supported_stages:
            return False
        # Remove the $text rejection - we'll handle it in the processing

    return True
```

## Example Pipeline Processing

### Before Enhancement
```javascript
[
  {"$match": {"status": "active"}},           // Processed in Python (10,000 docs)
  {"$sort": {"created": -1}},                 // Processed in Python (10,000 docs)  
  {"$match": {"$text": {"$search": "python"}}}, // Processed in Python (10,000 docs)
  {"$limit": 10}                              // Processed in Python (10,000 docs)
]
```
**Result**: All 10,000 documents processed in Python

### After Enhancement
```javascript
[
  {"$match": {"status": "active"}},           // SQL - Filter to 1,000 docs
  {"$sort": {"created": -1}},                 // SQL - Sort 1,000 docs
  {"$match": {"$text": {"$search": "python"}}}, // Python - Filter to 50 docs
  {"$limit": 10}                              // SQL - Take first 10 docs
]
```
**Result**: 
- First match: SQL processes 10,000→1,000 docs
- Sort: SQL processes 1,000 docs
- Text match: Python processes 1,000→50 docs
- Limit: SQL processes 50→10 docs
