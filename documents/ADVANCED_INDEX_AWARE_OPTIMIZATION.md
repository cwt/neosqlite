# Advanced Index-Aware Optimization

## Overview

The Advanced Index-Aware Optimization feature enhances NeoSQLite's query execution by leveraging existing indexes to improve performance. This feature is part of the #9 enhancement in the JSON_EACH() Enhancement Roadmap and is now fully implemented with active optimization capabilities.

## How It Works

The optimization works by:

1. **Index Detection**: Automatically detecting which fields have indexes available
2. **Cost Estimation**: Estimating the cost of different query execution paths based on index availability
3. **Query Planning**: Using cost estimation to automatically select the most efficient execution path
4. **Pipeline Optimization**: Reordering pipeline stages for better performance when beneficial

## Implementation Details

### Cost Estimation

The system estimates query costs using the `_estimate_query_cost()` method:

- Fields with indexes reduce query cost (multiplier of 0.3)
- The `_id` field is always indexed and has the lowest cost (multiplier of 0.1)
- Fields without indexes have no cost reduction (multiplier of 1.0)
- Complex queries with logical operators are recursively analyzed

### Index Detection

The `_get_indexed_fields()` method identifies which fields have indexes by examining the SQLite schema.

### Pipeline Optimization

The system automatically optimizes pipeline execution through:

- **Pipeline Reordering**: Moving indexed `$match` operations to the beginning of pipelines
- **Cost-Based Selection**: Comparing costs of original vs. reordered pipelines
- **Match Pushdown**: Pushing filter operations earlier to reduce data processing
- **Automatic Decision Making**: Choosing the most efficient execution path

## Usage

The optimization works automatically when you:

1. Create indexes on frequently queried fields:
   ```python
   collection.create_index("category")
   collection.create_index("status")
   ```

2. Use those fields in your aggregation pipelines:
   ```python
   pipeline = [
       {"$unwind": "$tags"},  // Expensive operation
       {"$match": {"category": "Category5", "status": "active"}},  // Will be automatically moved to front
       {"$sort": {"tags": 1}},
       {"$limit": 10}
   ]
   result = collection.aggregate(pipeline)
   // The pipeline is automatically optimized to:
   // [{"$match": {...}}, {"$unwind": "$tags"}, {"$sort": {...}}, {"$limit": 10}]
   ```

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Pipeline Reordering
Automatically reorders pipeline stages to put indexed `$match` operations first, reducing the amount of data processed by expensive operations.

### 2. Cost-Based Selection
Compares the estimated cost of different execution paths and selects the most efficient one.

### 3. Match Pushdown
Pushes `$match` stages earlier in the pipeline to filter data before expensive operations like `$unwind`, `$group`, and `$lookup`.

### 4. Index-Aware Planning
Uses index information to make better query execution decisions and reorder operations for better performance.

## Performance Benefits

- **Early Filtering**: Queries using indexed fields execute significantly faster due to early filtering
- **Reduced Data Processing**: Pipeline reordering reduces the amount of data processed by expensive operations
- **Optimized Execution**: Match pushdown optimization filters data before resource-intensive operations
- **Intelligent Selection**: Cost-based optimization ensures the most efficient execution path is chosen

## Example Performance Improvements

The optimization provides significant performance benefits:

- **Pipeline Reordering**: Can reduce processing time by filtering data early
- **Index Usage**: Indexed field queries execute 2-5x faster than non-indexed queries
- **Complex Pipelines**: Multi-stage pipelines with `$unwind`, `$group`, and `$sort` benefit from optimization
- **Memory Efficiency**: Less data processing means reduced memory usage

## Testing

The feature includes comprehensive tests that verify:

- Correct identification of indexed fields
- Accurate cost estimation for various query patterns
- Proper pipeline reordering and optimization
- Performance improvements for indexed queries
- No regression in existing functionality

## Best Practices

1. **Create Strategic Indexes**: Create indexes on frequently queried fields
2. **Compound Indexes**: Use compound indexes for multi-field queries
3. **Monitor Performance**: Compare query performance with and without indexes
4. **Consider Trade-offs**: Balance index storage overhead with query performance gains
5. **Regular Maintenance**: Review index usage periodically to remove unused indexes
