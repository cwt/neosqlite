# NeoSQLite API Feasibility Assessment

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of implementing missing PyMongo APIs in NeoSQLite, considering the project's nature as a SQLite-based document store with PyMongo compatibility.

## Project Nature Analysis

### Core Characteristics

**1. SQLite Foundation**
- Built on SQLite's relational database engine
- Uses a hybrid approach: JSON documents stored in 'data' column
- Leverages SQLite's ACID properties and performance
- Pure Python implementation with optional extensions

**2. Document Model Abstraction**
- Schema-less document storage within SQLite
- JSON/BSON-like document interface
- `_id` field handling with SQLite primary key

**3. Performance-First Design**
- Three-tier processing approach:
  1. SQL optimization (fastest)
  2. Temporary table aggregation (intermediate) 
  3. Python fallback (most flexible)
- Query translation from MongoDB-style to SQL
- Optimized for common use cases

**4. PyMongo Compatibility Layer**
- Familiar PyMongo-like API
- Method signatures and behavior mimic PyMongo
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Key Constraints

### Technical Constraints
1. **SQLite Limitations**: No native document model, limited JSON functions without extensions
2. **ACID vs. Eventual Consistency**: SQLite's strong consistency vs. MongoDB's eventual consistency model
3. **Single-threaded by Default**: Different from MongoDB's distributed nature
4. **Storage Format**: JSON serialization vs. native BSON storage

### Design Constraints
1. **Performance vs. Feature Trade-off**: Must maintain performance optimization goals
2. **Pure SQL vs. Complex Operations**: Some MongoDB operations don't translate well to SQL
3. **Local vs. Distributed**: SQLite is local-only, no distributed features

## Conclusion

The feasibility analysis indicates that NeoSQLite can implement most missing PyMongo APIs while maintaining its core value proposition of SQLite-based performance with PyMongo compatibility. The key is to focus on features that align with SQLite's strengths and avoid features that would compromise the performance-first design. The project should prioritize APIs that enhance compatibility without sacrificing the performance benefits that make NeoSQLite valuable.
