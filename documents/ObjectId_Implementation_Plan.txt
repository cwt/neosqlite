# MongoDB-compatible ObjectId Implementation

## Overview

Based on the analysis in @documents/PyMongo_API_Comparison.md @documents/API_DEVELOPMENT_STRATEGY.md @documents/API_FEASIBILITY_ASSESSMENT.md, the ObjectId implementation has been completed according to MongoDB's specification to provide full compatibility with PyMongo's ObjectId format.

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - MongoDB-compatible ObjectId implementation

## Implementation Plan (Completed)

### 1. Python `ObjectId` Class
* **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
* **Location**: `neosqlite/objectid.py`
* **Features**:
  * Generates 12-byte value following MongoDB specification:
    * 4 bytes: int(time.time()) - Unix timestamp
    * 3 bytes: os.urandom(3) - Random value for uniqueness
    * 2 bytes: os.getpid().to_bytes(2, 'big') - Process identifier
    * 3 bytes: Thread-safe incrementing counter - Sequence number
  * Full compatibility with MongoDB ObjectId operations
  * JSON serialization support via `encode_for_storage()` and `decode_from_storage()` methods
  * Thread-safe implementation with proper locking
  * Validation methods: `is_valid()`
  * Time extraction: `generation_time()`
  * String representations: `__str__`, `__repr__`, hex property
  * Equality and comparison operators: `__eq__`, `__ne__`, `__hash__`
  * **Performance Optimization**: _id column uses JSONB when available (same as data column) for better performance

### 2. Collection Table Schema Modifications
* **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
* **Schema**: (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, _id JSON UNIQUE, data JSON)
* **Backward Compatibility**: ✅ Ensured
  * New collections: Automatically created with `_id` column
  * Existing collections: `_id` column added via `ALTER TABLE` when needed
  * Unique index created: `idx_{collection_name}_id ON {collection_name}(_id)`
  * Automatic column detection and handling in `_get_stored_id()` method

### 3. CRUD Operations Integration
* **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
* **Insertion Operations** (`insert_one`, `insert_many`):
  * Documents without `_id` receive automatically generated ObjectId
  * Documents with user-provided `_id` preserve the original value
  * ObjectId hex stored in dedicated `_id` column
  * Document's `_id` field populated with ObjectId instance
* **Retrieval Operations** (`find`, `find_one`, etc.):
  * Both integer `id` and ObjectId `_id` columns retrieved
  * `_load_with_stored_id()` method handles proper ObjectId reconstruction
  * Automatic fallback to integer ID for legacy documents
* **Update/Deletion Operations**:
  * Updated to work with both integer IDs and ObjectIds
  * `_get_integer_id_for_oid()` method retrieves integer ID for internal operations
  * SQL translation handles `_id` queries correctly

### 4. Test Coverage and Validation
* **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
* **Test File**: `tests/test_objectid.py`
* **Coverage**:
  * ObjectId creation from various sources (new, hex string, bytes, existing ObjectId)
  * Equality and comparison operations
  * String representations and serialization
  * Timestamp extraction and validation
  * Uniqueness verification across multiple instances
  * JSON serialization integration
  * Storage and retrieval integration with collections
  * Backward compatibility with existing collections
  * Index usage verification for efficient lookups
  * MongoDB interchangeability testing

## Key Features Achieved

### MongoDB Compatibility
* ✅ 12-byte structure identical to MongoDB ObjectIds
* ✅ Hex string representation compatibility (24-character strings)
* ✅ Timestamp extraction compatibility
* ✅ Cross-conversion between NeoSQLite and PyMongo ObjectId formats

### Performance Optimizations
* ✅ Dedicated `_id` column with unique index for fast lookups
* ✅ Query plan optimization verified through EXPLAIN
* ✅ Efficient SQL-based retrieval using both integer and ObjectId lookups

### Integration Points
* ✅ JSON serialization/deserialization with custom encoder
* ✅ Collection schema backward compatibility
* ✅ All CRUD operations updated to handle ObjectIds
* ✅ Query engine updated to support `_id` field queries

## API Compatibility

The implementation provides full compatibility with PyMongo's ObjectId expectations:
* Automatic generation when no `_id` is provided during insertion
* Manual assignment when user provides `_id`
* Proper indexing and query support
* JSON serialization compatibility
* Hex string interchangeability with PyMongo

## Testing Performed

### Unit Tests
* ObjectId creation and validation
* Serialization and deserialization
* Thread safety and uniqueness
* Timestamp extraction

### Integration Tests
* Storage in SQLite with proper indexing
* Retrieval with both integer and ObjectId lookups
* Backward compatibility with existing data
* Query performance with index verification
* MongoDB interchangeability using PyMongo

## Performance Verification

* Index usage confirmed through EXPLAIN query plans
* Efficient lookups using dedicated `_id` column
* Backward compatibility maintained without performance degradation
* Memory-efficient object creation and processing

## Implementation Summary

The MongoDB-compatible ObjectId implementation has been successfully completed, providing:
1. Full compatibility with MongoDB ObjectId format and behavior
2. Efficient storage and retrieval in SQLite
3. Backward compatibility with existing collections
4. Proper indexing for performance
5. Complete test coverage and validation
6. Interchangeability with PyMongo ObjectIds
