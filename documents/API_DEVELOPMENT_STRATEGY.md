# NeoSQLite API Development Strategy

## Executive Summary

Based on the feasibility analysis, this document outlines the strategic approach for implementing missing PyMongo APIs in NeoSQLite while maintaining the project's core performance and architectural goals.

## Strategic Principles

### 1. Performance-First Priority
- Maintain the three-tier optimization approach (SQL → Temporary Tables → Python)
- Never implement features that significantly compromise performance
- Prioritize APIs that can leverage SQL optimization

### 2. SQLite-Native Design
- Embrace SQLite's ACID properties and local-only nature
- Leverage SQLite's unique strengths (lightweight, zero-config, reliable)
- Avoid trying to replicate distributed MongoDB features

### 3. PyMongo Compatibility
- Maintain API compatibility where it makes sense
- Provide sensible defaults for MongoDB-specific features
- Implement proper fallbacks for unsupported features

### 4. Incremental Enhancement
- Focus on high-impact, high-feasibility APIs first
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage for new features

## Implementation Priority Matrix

### Tier 1: High Impact, High Feasibility (✅ COMPLETED)
- ✅ ObjectId support - MongoDB-compatible 12-byte ObjectIds with full hex interchangeability
- Enhanced datetime handling
- Method aliases (find_and_modify, count, etc.)
- Basic collation support

### Tier 2: Medium Impact, Medium Feasibility (Recommended: Next 3-4 releases)
- Advanced text search features (scoring, language options)
- Additional aggregation stages that can use SQL optimization
- JSON Schema validation
- Basic session-like context managers

### Tier 3: Low Priority or Avoid (Not Recommended)
- map_reduce (performance degradation risk)
- Parallel operations (architectural mismatch)
- Complex distributed features (not aligned with SQLite)
- Geospatial features (requires SQLite extensions)

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Risk
- Always profile new implementations
- Maintain performance benchmarks
- Revert features that degrade existing performance

### Complexity Risk
- Keep new APIs simple and focused
- Leverage existing architecture patterns
- Maintain code quality and test coverage

### Compatibility Risk
- Thorough testing of new features
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Clear documentation of differences from PyMongo

## Success Metrics

### Short-term Metrics (Next 6 months)
- 95%+ PyMongo API compatibility for core features
- Maintain current performance benchmarks
- Add 5-10 new high-feasibility APIs

### Medium-term Metrics (Next 12 months)
- Complete implementation of Tier 1 and Tier 2 features
- Maintain or improve performance across all operations
- Expand test coverage to new APIs

### Long-term Vision (Next 2 years)
- Comprehensive PyMongo compatibility (90%+ coverage)
- Maintain position as fastest PyMongo-compatible solution for SQLite
- Strong developer adoption and positive feedback

## Resource Allocation

### Development Focus
- 70% of effort on performance-critical features
- 20% on compatibility features
- 10% on new functionality exploration

### Testing Priority
- Performance regression testing
- API compatibility verification
- Cross-version compatibility

## Conclusion

This strategy ensures that NeoSQLite remains true to its core value proposition of providing PyMongo-like API compatibility with SQLite-based performance. By focusing on high-feasibility APIs that align with SQLite's strengths, the project can continue to enhance compatibility without compromising its performance-first design.
