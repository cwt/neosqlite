# NeoSQLite API Analysis Summary

This document summarizes the analysis of NeoSQLite's API compatibility with PyMongo and lists all generated documentation files.

## Analysis Overview

NeoSQLite provides a comprehensive PyMongo-compatible API for SQLite databases, implementing approximately 95%+ of the core PyMongo Collection APIs. The analysis identified several missing APIs and operators that could enhance compatibility and feature completeness.

## Generated Documentation Files

1. **MISSING_APIS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**
   - Detailed implementation plan for all missing APIs and operators
   - Categorized by priority level
   - Implementation strategies and code examples

2. **API_COMPATIBILITY_REPORT.md**
   - Comprehensive comparison of NeoSQLite vs PyMongo APIs
   - Lists implemented and missing APIs
   - Recommendations for improvement

3. **IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md**
   - Prioritized roadmap for implementing missing features
   - Timeline and success metrics
   - Risk mitigation strategies

## Key Findings

### High Priority Missing APIs
- Database operations: `list_collections()` - ✅ COMPLETED
- Advanced aggregation: `aggregate_raw_batches()` - ✅ COMPLETED

### High Priority Missing Operators
- Logical operators: `$and`, `$or`, `$not`, `$nor` (incomplete implementation) - ✅ COMPLETED
- Array operators: `$all` - ✅ COMPLETED
- Element operators: `$type` - ✅ COMPLETED

### Implementation Recommendations

1. **Immediate Focus**: Implement remaining P0 items (Critical Priority) - ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Short-term Goal**: Complete P1 items (High Priority) - ✅ COMPLETED
3. **Long-term Vision**: Address P2-P3 items as needed

## Next Steps

1. Review the implementation plan in MISSING_APIS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Continue following the prioritized roadmap in IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
3. Use the compatibility report in API_COMPATIBILITY_REPORT.md as a reference
4. Focus on implementing remaining P1-P3 items

This analysis provides a clear path forward for enhancing NeoSQLite's PyMongo compatibility while maintaining its unique advantages as a SQLite-based NoSQL solution.
