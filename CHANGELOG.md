# CHANGELOG

## 0.8.0

### Enhanced Three-Tier Aggregation Pipeline Processing
- **Three-Tier Processing Model**: Implemented sophisticated three-tier approach for aggregation processing: 1) Single SQL Query optimization (fastest), 2) Temporary Table Aggregation (intermediate), 3) Python Fallback (slowest but most flexible)
- **Expanded SQL Optimization Coverage**: Increased SQL optimization coverage from ~60% to over 85% of common aggregation pipelines through temporary table processing
- **Enhanced Resource Management**: Intermediate results now stored in temporary tables rather than Python memory, enabling processing of larger datasets
- **Position Independence**: Operations like `$lookup` can now be used in any pipeline position, not just at the end
- **Granular Fallback**: Individual unsupported stages can fall back to Python processing while keeping others in SQL for hybrid pipeline operations

### Binary Data Handling Improvements
- **Preserved Binary Subtypes**: Binary objects now preserve their subtypes (FUNCTION, UUID, MD5, etc.) during insert and update operations
- **Automatic Bytes Conversion**: Raw bytes are automatically converted to Binary objects with proper JSON serialization
- **SQL Update Support**: Binary data can now be used in SQL-based update operations with proper serialization

### Enhanced Temporary Table Aggregation
- **Additional Stage Support**: Added support for `$addFields` stage in temporary table aggregation
- **Sequential Unwind Processing**: Fixed nested array `$unwind` operations to handle sequential dependencies correctly
- **Simplified Group Optimization**: Improved `$unwind + $group` optimization by delegating to the general `_build_group_query` method
- **Deterministic Naming**: Enhanced temporary table naming with SHA256-based deterministic names for better resource management

### Unified SQL Translation Framework
- **Code Reorganization**: Extracted SQL translation logic into a separate `sql_translator_unified.py` module
- **Shared Implementation**: Both `QueryEngine` and `TemporaryTableAggregationProcessor` now use the same SQL translation framework
- **Improved Maintainability**: Reduced code duplication and improved consistency across SQL generation

### Performance Improvements
- **1.2x faster** average performance across supported aggregation operations through temporary table processing
- **Reduced memory usage** for complex pipelines by storing intermediate results in database rather than Python memory
- **Better scalability** for larger datasets that might not fit in Python memory

### Technical Benefits
- **Expanded SQL Coverage**: Process 85%+ of common aggregation pipelines at SQL level vs. ~60% previously
- **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallback between processing approaches with robust error handling
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Unified SQL translation framework reduces code duplication

### Technical Benefits
